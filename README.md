# hello-world

Let's get acquainted! My name is Dima.

At the moment, I work in the security company "Venbest" and I want to develop into "IT technologies".

I do not speak very well in English. Well, it's not a problem I can always catch up. At the moment, I would rate my level by 2 in the pitabal system :)
I am a person who believes in himself, everything is simple, if you believe, then everything will turn out.I have bad habits, well, who is not without sin. :)Optimistically tuned to life, I like listening to music in the genre of rap or rock, for the excerpt Istrmmintal is also a subject of norms)
